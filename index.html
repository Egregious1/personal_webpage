            <em class="blogdate">3.19.20</em>
            <p class="blogentry">I really don't know what the hell i just did today. I tried pull from my git repo on my laptop like I usually do, although it has been a while since I have done any work on my laptop as of late. I tried my pull request and get greeted with an error message. No bigge I have delt with plenty of them before and its time to stretch my google-fu a bit and see what it was that I was actually missing when I was doing all that I did.
            <br>
            I have to admit that I wasnt doing much work on my laptop and opting to spend most of my time using my pc since I was gaming a lot more and I just got my new laptop from china finally! I know so many jokes would be made at my expense if i wasnt lagging it on getting this damn site up and maybe telling a few people about it too. fat chance. Anywho... to stop making this very short story so damn long I ended up removing every file from my repo on github and ended up deleting that repo and starting a new one and messed that up a feww times. I finally have it all fixed to the best that I can think since all the changes i really wanted were still on my pc. Now I have to start a new clone on my laptop and hopefully have the right files available to me when I go to pull them. I feel like I am making some leeway on this thing and its slowly getting better and better to me. Everytime I do show someone what I am working on it really gets me thinking about ways to make it better since I never feel confidant at all. I might be too much of a downer on myself since I am learning all this by myself and with mostly just desire. Its still there even if I am a lazy fuck that tends to put things off for far to long most of the time. Thats a me probelm anyway.

            <em>ps:</em>
            <br>
            Covid-19 has put me in my apartment for the next 2 weeks and possibly more. I should be using this time to learn more and get deeper into this world of code. The first two days(or was it three?) have been solely in a leasuire manner. These next few days I need to take some time out of my day and devote to just coding. Either working on this page or continue learning. I cant let this mind go to waste. Its not the smartest but I feel like I can do something decent.

                I made a mistake. I decided to not check the weather today since you
                know I live in the state of perpetual summer and it never rains. Its
                pouring and I wasnt prepared. I have my laptop with me in a shitty
                backpack that is due for replacement, which I will probably do today.
                I am in a t-shirt that is too thin and the only pair of
                non-wet-resistant pants I own. Its just a perfect mess of awful.
                <br />
                This rain is just getting worse to the point that I just get soaked
                going a few doors down from where I work...shit its days like this
                that make me wish my car was operational. These days are few and far
                between so I shouldn't be complaining too much about this.

            <em class="blogdate">03.17.20</em>
            <p class="blogentry">
                I got a my new keyboard finally! I really like it so far its a 60%
                board with a dedicated arrow cluster which I am still a little unsure
                about but so far I dig it and I am not having much issue with using
                the right shift key. The only thing I am usure about is the switches I
                am using. I am sure they are gateron reds but they sent me 2 gateron
                blues with the package but i think its just what they do as a company.
                These things are so soft that breathing on them too hard will engage
                them. I think I like it so far but I do make a lot of mistakes because
                of it. I am just starting to game with it and just now I selected the
                last senstence I just typed and deleted it. I have to be much more
                acurate with my typing so I dont make so many mistakes. It will just
                take a little work but I think I want to get different switches.
                Something a little firmer but I really like this feel on the keys and
                the sound. It is so much more soothing. The stabilizers on the board
                are also something new to me. To be fair I have only been using razor
                products so what do I really know?
                <br />
                I really do like the way this keyboard feels under my hands. Its
                smooth but still needs some lube to get the rest of the noise out of
                the key presses. I kind of wish it had a more pronounced bump and a
                little more resistance but this is why I bought this hotswappable 60%
                keyboard. So I can find my perfect combo! Its going to be a process.
                But I have everything I need to make this work in the future.
                <br />
                On another not my work has given me the next two weeks off due to the
                corona virus and safety of people. I need to take some of this time to
                hunker down and learn as much as i can but try not to burn out. I
                think it will be a good time since I dont really have anything else to
                do right? <em>until next time</em>

            <p class="blogentry">
                Well I changed so much on the site today! I might not be done for the
                night, but for right now it feels good. I cleaned it up a whole lot
                changed some of the class tags and added a logo. That thing up there
                looks alright if I do say so. I think I want to remove the borders
                around. I want to find some great way to make the background all smexy
                and stuff. It feels nice having a little bit of progress as always. I
                have some better plans for the navbar but at the moment I feel like
                its in a good place. Now I really have to take the time to understand
                how to launch this damn thing properly so I can get it out there and
                really start making changes. There is so much to do and its so damn
                fun! <br />
                Alright its been about a day since I made these major changes. I
                haven't had any time to actually do anything more to the current state
                of the code. Now I really want to break up this page since its gotten
                so long and unruly. I am thinking about creating a page for about
                three posts a page to contain things in a better way. I might want to
                look into tags and a way to group them in the future once I decide to
                purge this or start another blog page entirely so I dont have so much
                useless bloat on my main page. I think it'll be a great transition
                into making better pages. I need to really start focusing on one thing
                at a time. At the moment my udemy class has me starting with bootstrap
                3 and 4 but I am not confident enough in my css and I would really
                like to learn javascript as well since its so integral to most of what
                goes on in the interwebs. Its not a crazy thing to want to focus all
                my attention on one aspect of my goals right? <br />
                Its just so strange though I want to be able to be more productive but
                I think I have way too many distractions around me. I think I need to
                spend a little more time on my own maybe somewhere a little far from
                everyone or at least spend some time somewhere with a good wifi
                connection and no way for me to get back to my gaming rig. I might
                just be spending too much time blaming everything but myself. I should
                really just get my brain and body healthy and use that to keep myself
                on track. I will make this work!

            <p class="blogentry">
                I just checked on the status of my school entry. Looks like my past
                loan that was taken out on my name. It's unfortunate because at the
                time that it was done my parents (mainly my father but whats past is
                past) convinced me to stop persuring my want to be a photographer and
                instead go into computers because 'I like playing games so much'. I
                mean the rational was not wrong by any means. Look what I am trying to
                do now. I just hated being told what to do with my life then and even
                now. I am a little more apt to listen at this point in my life and
                just use or not use the information given to me. (lets be honest I can
                barely listen to anyone which is probably why my life is a little bit
                of a mess right now.) It's fine though. I mean its just another
                obsticle, nothing I cant over come with a little bit of hard work
                right? <br />
                I put myself down a lot. Its hard not to when you expect so much out
                of yourself when doing anything. I hate losing and I hate not being
                good at something to the point where if it feels unattainable I will
                just half ass the hell out of it. I also have some huge trouble with
                putting my attention where it would be the most beneficial to my own
                well being. It's tough trying to keep my head in the right frame of
                mind when all I really want to do is just flood it with garbage time
                wasters. I have been getting much better at allocating some times to
                my self for self improvement. I am always stressed that its not enough
                but I need to take a step back and understand that this will be a
                journey not a sprint. I will need to take my time so I can learn what
                I want and get to a level that I can be proud of. <br />
                Baby steps...its all baby steps...

            <h1 class="blogtitle">Two days gone</h1>
            <p class="blogentry">
                So Its been a couple days now. I kind of let myself have a moment
                where I went a little crazy and tried to unwind a bit. It was a litte
                good for me in the long run. I have been working so damn much that I
                needed a little bit of me time outside of learning and working. The
                real issue is that I have a problem with "taking breaks". I always end
                not being able to get back into the same kind tempo that I was at
                before I take the break. Too many distractions to be honest. I live in
                such a small space with another person and to be honest I should not
                be doing that but they are my friend so I cant just let them be in a
                terrible spot. I am still waiting my new mechanical deck. I want to
                spend some time with it so I can figure out what exactly I want out of
                a keyboard. I am getting really sick of typing on this razr widow what
                ever that I have been using. Its not terrible dont get me wrong I am
                just getting tired of the noise. Its super sharp and hard to
                concentrate. It also feels like I would be totally annoyed from
                hearing this noise as much as I have to put others through.
                <br />
                The size of this thing is too much for the space that I have. Its
                getting in the way of gaming and also just being able to have a
                notepad on my desk or something so I can write down ideas and things a
                little better (the ability to sketch out parts of my ideas is a pretty
                nice to have!) Not having the right amount of space is also kind of
                annoying for my mouse hand to. I feel as though I always have to have
                my arms so far apart just to get the proper balance in space and
                comfort. Its super annoying I can not lie. Sometimes I end up on the
                wrong keys at the worst times. <br />
                To be honest I don't really know what I am doing. Sure I have an idea
                of where I want to be when in a few months to a year, but I am also
                feeling kind of hopeless and lost. I feel like I know nothing at all
                but I know I am making some kind of progress how ever small. I just
                really need a way to feel like I am heading in the right direction
                with things. Maybe I am not utilizing the sevices that are open to me
                enough. I go on these sites but I have so much trouble just connecting
                with people. Guess its time to get a little shrink on myself: <br />
                Am I being too afraid of being shitty at the things that I set myself
                out on? Why do I do that to myself when I already know that I cant
                hold myself up to such a high standard when I am just starting out
                something. Its my new thing at the moment and its for once something
                that I really feel great about and it can lead into a better life. I
                am probably spending way too much time thinking about the end-game
                when I should be thinking about what I can do today. I get so ahead of
                myself all the time in nearly everything that I try to learn or
                anything new for that matter. Its like everything I do has to be some
                kind of major victory in my life. Like I need to be a pro at
                everything I do or else what am I wasting my time for? It cant be a
                very healthy way to go about my life. Its such a competative
                enviroment for no damn reason. Its really silly if I think about it.
                People can be really screwed up in the funniest of ways huh. I think I
                need to change my target on what I need to be competative on. I think
                I like what I am trying to do. When things work they make me feel
                powerful. Like I can actually make an impact with something. I would
                love to be able to work hard enough to get as good as some. I think I
                have it in me and I have these crazy impossible dreams of possibly
                being apart of something really great. Maybe that is what really
                drives those billionares. To be able to actually change the world.
                <br />
                Many if not all of those people have changed the world hopefully
                mostly for the better. Its so hard to really see what the future lies
                and whats good today may be bad tomorrow, but its all in the name of
                progress right? <br />
                I am sorry. This was a long one. I have had way too much time on my
                hands lately and I have been pissing it away haven't I? I just need to
                get my head in the game where it should be shouldnt I? Its so easy its
                fucking laugable. <em>until next time</em>

                Its obvious that I don't have a real good sense of how I should be
                formating my code when building this site. I think I should be
                spending more time building different sites instead of just sitting on
                this garbage pile haha. Maybe I should try going through the
                responsive web design tests on freecodecamp.org and just see if i can
                come up with some nice new things. Then I can spend some much needed
                time practicing jscript since I have an okay understanding on how
                python sort of operates. Not really haha. <br />
                I do like the way this text editors operates. I know its not the most
                productive of methods considering I have no autocomplete on my tags or
                anything but I still feel like this will make me a better programmer
                in general since I will have to think about every action I am taking
                and when I do go back to something like visual studio code I can
                utilize those amazing features much better. <br />
                Something I am very happy about is my ability to touch type. Its
                gotten so much better than I could ever imagine. Sure I always felt
                pretty comfortable with typing but now I know so much more of the
                board that its actually really exciting. Even all those special keys
                and the number row! <br />
                <span class="rant">rant time</span> Where I work I have been put in
                charge of maintaining the instagram account of the the store. This is
                something that I am horrible at but its been thrust on me and now I
                feel so anxious about everything that I have to do concerning it. It's
                honestly making me want to leave the company I work for as soon as I
                can. I guess its another one of those inspirations I need to keep my
                head down and keep trying to learn as much as I can because I am not
                really making much headway with the way I have been going about things
                lately. <br />
                Okay its time for more distractions even though I was completely
                turned away from this because of how loud my damn keyboard is. These
                switches are just so damn loud! When is my new deck coming??

                What the hell did I do?! <br />
                I kept working on my python project and I kept feeling good about all
                the new things that I was learning. I understood some functions that
                in theory should have made my code cleaner but then I try to use them
                and it broke everything! Then i revert all the changes I made and now
                the average calculator wont work at all... Its so fucking frustrating!
                <br />
                I think the worst part is that I don't know enough to ask the right
                questions to get the answers I am looking for. I am very impatient,
                but I feel like I have been doing an amazing job at being patient
                about all of this. For me at least. Well...I probably havent been
                going at this the right way anywho. I should be a little more
                regimented on how I use my time to practice and to learn. It would be
                benifical to me to set some work space time and a todo list so I can
                work on certain tasks first before just randomly stabbing at the code
                and hoping that what I am doing isnt going to break it again. <br />
                Maybe I just want this too much right now. I want these things to
                work! I want to be better at webdev. I want to be able to push a
                website live and have it work and be where I want it to be right now.
                I have these grandious plans, but I know it wont be where I invision
                it just yet. I still am not sleeping nearly as much as I should be. I
                am taking away from my work awareness to practice which can be
                healthy. Its okay though, I have a week off work starting tomorrow
                after 5. I need to set a plan in motion to keep myself in the right
                state of mind so I can progress further instead of slumping into a
                depressed sack of garbage who thinks they cant hack it. <br />
                I need some inspo. I need to spend some time with friends. I need a
                moment to think differently... I need art. <br />
                Thats it. I need to get my emotions out on a page or canvas and just
                let go for a moment. I think I will do that this weekend at some point
                and allow myself so time for free expression. Away from the keywords
                and functions and just smear color everywhere. I think that will do me
                right. <br />
                Or maybe just get a therapist...

                I think I just had a breakthrough again. Fuck every time I do
                something new it feels like I just had a major breakthrough in my
                python coding. Now that I understand how functions and global
                functions work I will be able to take my clunky code for my CSGO
                calculator and make it more slimlined. As of right now I have it set
                to have user names and which map you are currently tracking and it
                does everything else like normal (except the average i fucked that up
                some how) I am glad I decided to get out of bed and watch more of my
                udemy classes. I feel like I am getting more out it trying to progress
                as much as i can in my own project and researching until I get stuck
                and i start watching videos to get an understanding of the
                fundamentals better. I can absorb it a little easier now that I have
                something tangible to work from and reference besides the made up
                programs that get used in teaching. Its at least working during my
                self taught career so far lol.
                <br />
                I want to get this site up and running on an actually domain. It will
                be the fire I need to keep going and learning this while I fill my
                head with python. If i am paying for it i might as well do it right?
                We will see how long this takes.

                Man I do love the way sublime works I want all the functions that
                sublime gives me with html and impliment it to emacs. I am still a
                total nubbin with emacs (no shit) so I am still slowly going through
                the steps. <br />
                Anywho, I am here to try and retake what I was doing for its intended
                purpose. I will try to keep the crazy to a minimum. I built my csgo
                calc app inside of repl and I saved it to my github as I stated
                before. I think its at a really nice place and its inspiring me to
                start working on learning flask since I think it will reach its full
                potential as a web app. something that can easily be used with button
                clicks. I also have a vision of user specific data that can be called
                on to give an average over the lifetime of the user and other
                intervals (day, week, month, year, season, ect) and game type specific
                counts (comp, wingman, casual, deathmatch, ect) its a simple design
                that I think can actually be useful even if its not the most original.
                Its my baby project what can I say I want to make it as beautiful as I
                can lol. I am still so new to all this programing that I am learning
                so much every time I try to progress some of it just kind of blows
                over my head a bit. Maybe taking a step away from my deck a bit will
                help with getting all this to mesh. I might just go rock climbing
                today and think about something else than my code for once. <br />
                Maybe. <br />
                Im starting to look at this code and its looking super sketch and I
                don't know how to prettify this damn thing. Will probably take some
                times to do that today. I think its possible in VSC will be checking
                that now:
                <br />
                <code>======== loading ========</code>
                <br />
                okay not sure if this is any better because now it looks a little odd.
                I am going to keep it this way until I can figure out a better way to
                impliment a better look to the code. Chances are I might have to scrap
                the whole thing and start over but something tells me that might not
                be worth it. As I am writing this vsc is changing the formatting which
                I guess is fine but its doing it in the middle of sentences as if the
                wordwrap is all buggy. I dont know will need test further.

                I think I do like DOOM emacs a lot more than vanilla emacs. Sure its a
                whole new thing to be honest with functions I cant even understand
                without some serious thinking and reading. Hell the
                <code>spc-g-g</code> terminal thingy is so confusing I can't figure it
                out. I just prefer the regular terminal. I am confident traversing
                that. I do have to admit though the doom emacs terminal looks really
                freaking cool! I still cant figure out org. I am not understanding
                videos that I am seeing and I am probably not getting the
                documentation as I am reading it. I am probably too tired to really
                absorb it. I'll just have to keep trying. <br />
                I don't really get what emacs navigation controls actually work on
                doom and which don't. the
                <code> c-l </code>still works just fine but a lot of the other
                navigation controls I just got used to give me completely different
                outcomes! Its okay thought like I said before I think this is going to
                be a really good change. I feel like I am going to fall over from
                exhuastion at any moment. I cant even think properly to be honest and
                I am acting erratic. My shit spelling is getting even worse than it
                normally is. I can say that my touch typing is getting a little bit
                better but not in a traditional way. I tend to do mostly 2-3 fingers
                with some pinky-fu thrown in but mostly i dont stay on the home row at
                all its really weird. Its funny how I taught myself to type mainly
                from gaming and just giving it a go with all the writting i attempt to
                do. If this blog was any indication I am utter shit at writting but I
                keep trying anyway. I think my biggest problem is lack of editing. I
                like the word vomit style most likely because it feels the most
                theraputic. I can explode on a page and feel all the better for it.I
                also feel like I am falling ill. I want to just assume its from lack
                of sleep but something still tells me it could be something worse. I
                wont say its covid-19 but it does feel like I am getting a cold or
                something. my body is feeling weird and its doing things in an unusual
                manner. Nothing insane just stuff not being how it used to be. It
                could be my diet too who knows. I would like to keep my mind off all
                of this shit to be honest but its hard to keep it away. <br />
                I am real enjoying emacs and doom emacs. I have been spending a lot of
                time in here trying new things and of course the erc is keeping me
                distracted just enough to keep me going. Its actually even more
                enjoyable with doom emacs. The navigation is a lot more intuative even
                though its a whole new language I have to get used to. Its still nice
                to not have to do guess work when trying to find something in the dir.
                I am feeling more and more confident everyday with everything but I am
                not denying my skills are seriously lacking. I keep saying that dont
                i? I have to keep myself in check so I dont let my self esteem crushed
                by my lack of honest self apraisal. I want to be good enough for a job
                as fast as I can. I cant let myself forget that teaching myself is
                going to slow down the process. Thats why I am so hopefully about my
                chances getting back into school. I am going to a trade school but at
                least its some kind of CS learning in and around people who are trying
                to accomplish the same thing I am. I need to be able to learn from
                people around me not just from yt and stackoverflow.com even though
                they are invaluable sources of information there is something to be
                said from learning face to face. I can retain more and I will be far
                more excited about how everything pans out. <br />
                Here I am ranting again. <br />
                My new keyboard is coming! I think it just got shipped out of cn but I
                have no idea how long until it gets here. I don't even know if its
                coming to my coast or getting shipped out East and then getting
                shipped across country. Who knows I just want that 60% beauty that
                will be coming. Its nothing expensive just a gk64 I think its called i
                got it because of pcb being hot swappable and a standard keyboard
                size. I am hoping it wont take much time to learn how to utilize it
                because I need a new way to type. I enjoy the board on this 600 usd
                laptop that I got back in the early 2010's back when win8 was the
                standard. It upgraded to win10 then it slowed so bad from years of
                bloat and probably porn that I decided to nuke it and install linux.
                Glad I did, its been fueling my desire to learn all I can to be a
                programmer. Its a love hate relationship tbh. I spent so much time in
                front of computers that I started to resent them because they took so
                much time away from me but I never spent enough time creating like I
                always wanted to do as a child but now I understand where I was
                getting it wrong.

                    I guess I do hate myself. I just start getting a handle on vanilla
                    emacs and then I decide its time to change things on myself yet
                    again. it took a while to figure out what I was foing wrong but I
                    managed to get the dang thing installed. Took some file managment
                    and poof that nifty DOOM logo appears and I feel all happy. That is
                    until I realise I have never used vim and I know nothing about the
                    key binds let alone I barely learned what c-z did just a day or two
                    ago. Now I dont know what to do to get it back to normal with out
                    nuking the distro and starting over from scratch. Good Thing I dont
                    really have anything on here that matters. Its probably for the best
                    any way to just format the drive and start fresh. If I did that
                    though I would probably throw myself into arch or debian because...I
                    hate myself. <br />
                    Man the way this thing edits html is fucking weird. I think I will
                    need to rtfm for a while and see what it is I am missing. At least I
                    get some shortcuts again. It was trying to figure out how to write
                    with out help, and to be honest I think I prefer it that way. I
                    learned how much I really didnt know about elements I used all the
                    time because vsc and sublime just do all the tedious things for you.
                    For me they shouldnt be tedious because I am still learning but hey
                    live and learn.

                First, lets be real. The craziness of my world is so stupid and the
                people here have to know it. So many things to argue about that mean
                nothing. So many issues from people that have no real weight in life.
                Just a bunch of hot fucking air. Covid-19 is not it. Its fucking big
                time real get scared about what might happen shit. I don't worry much
                about wars, attacks, famines all that much but virus infections scare
                me. Its the one thing that has done the most damage to the human race
                in our misrtably short existence. Countless forms of illness that can
                take us down in a very short and truamatic fashion. It can spread like
                fire and when you finally know whats happening it can be all too late.
                I don't like being all doomsday preachy but I am telling everyone to
                just stock up on some food to be ready. I feel like its a stupid idea
                to not be a little cautious about everything. Even as I type this I
                feel as though I am falling ill. I wish it was just some
                hypochondriactic thing but I have been feeling it for a while now and
                have tried ignoring it in case its nothing. I am still concerned.
                <br />
                I live in a densly populated city wrought with homelessness and filth
                everywhere not to mention I pass one of the largest travel hubs in the
                country if not the world. I am too uneducated to even know and I never
                really gave it much thought until recently. There are already reports
                of unknowing infected possibly spreading the virus to people traveling
                around the world and I may have interacted with them multiple times a
                day going too and from work. My commute takes me right next to the
                airport. We are all so congested and close to each other we would be
                able to help spreading it around like it was going out of style. I
                worry about my family, my parents are both older so the virus could be
                fatal. I want to put it out of my head and move through the world like
                I will live forever but I can not do that anymore. <br />
                I don't really know what I am saying anymore. I had some kind of
                intentions for this post. I tried learning today but I am just too
                upset about whats happening. I need to take care of myself more.
                <br />
                Oh new girl is really cute. Sucks she is much younger than I. Smart as
                hell too and talented but you know younger than I like. It sounds
                worse than it is shes 20. Still hope she does something with her
                talent it is very good. Its probably what has me so attracted to her.
                I mean I didnt care for her that much before seeing her work. Its my
                cycle what can I say.

                <p class="blogentry">
                    I did it. I finally completed a python project that is totally all
                    my own. Well completed is not the exact words I would use but the
                    code finally does almost exactly what I want it to do! It is up in
                    my github repo (link at the bottom of the page hopefully by now I
                    have coded in a navbar...hopefully) Its a super simple program that
                    I though would be nice to have while playing some CSGO and thinking
                    'man it would be really cool if I could just track all my wins and
                    loses and get an average'. Looks like I did just that! Well its
                    really basic and it really just works off of inputs in to the
                    terminal, but hell its a start right? I am still learing so much
                    from the python beginnner course I am taking on udemy and its not
                    the best thing in the world but it is putting me in a great mood
                    about every thing I have been doing. It all feels worth it so far. I
                    guess that joy of creating something out of nothing will never leave
                    me. Its always been something that I loved to do, to create with my
                    own hands no matter what it is. I paint poorly but I still create
                    art. I crochet pretty well and make things people love. I even cook
                    pretty well and it brings joy to their hearts. Now I can create for
                    myself again and love everything I am doing. I cant get enough of it
                    considering I tend to spend the majority of my free time learning
                    and working and when I feel that I have made progress (or am
                    frustrated enough) I then go back to my friends and allow myself
                    some time to be human which mostly consists of me playing CSGO and
                    thinking about my code. Unless its comp then I am diving in baby!
                    Well any who I have a new project on github and I fixed some of the
                    labeling problems on here. <br />
                    Using emacs has really changed my way I do my html code. Since I
                    havent done anything to fuck with the config file of emacs I have to
                    type out every tage and make sure every class is added. no more
                    <br />
                    <code>div.classtag</code> <br />
                    to speed up the process and I think it will in turn make me a better
                    coder and programmer since I have to be far more aware of what I am
                    typing and making sure my syntax is on point. <br />
                    Anywho I am getting exhausted from lack of sleep and working so much
                    and spending way too much time up and coding and on irc. I love it
                    but I think its going to affect my regular life pretty soon. I am
                    not the same person I used to be still fat but now I feel it. I need
                    to get healthier so I can spend more time coding and less time
                    thinking about why sleep is not working how it used. I need my brain
                    to work at its best so I can learn and be aware. Tomorrow will be my
                    start of being more aware of my water intake. Try to limit my sugar
                    intake as much as possible (refined sugars obviously) and limiting
                    my carb intake while boosting my protien intake. Its a bit much I
                    know but I need to keep it in my mind. If it take baby steps to lose
                    the amount of weight I want to which right now to be reasonable
                    would be 20lbs. I think thats enough with out going too crazy. Most
                    of my weight seems to be from bloat right now. At least this fat
                    fucking gut seems to be. It keeps going up and down. Ugh...I might
                    have a slightly unhealthy view of myself, but if I don't fat shame
                    myself, no one will. I need it and it will help me in the future to
                    be better and to live better. I need to love myself more. I mean I
                    tend to keep people away from me and try not to send myself on the
                    self destructive path that has been me seeking partnership. I really
                    just need a friend who loves me and cares about me. I don't need the
                    issues that arise when having expectations thrusted on you to be a
                    certain kind of boyfriend. I also don't believe anyone should be
                    subjected to the kind of love that I have to offer. Its probably for
                    the best the last girl in my life (I admit I wasnt even attracted to
                    her to the point that I stopped sleeping with her for my own sake.)
                    ended up finding someone new. It was a positive thing for the both
                    of us and I told her I was happy for her. We should be happy for
                    others finding happiness even if it doesn't involve ourselves.
                    Goodness should be spread not contained. <br />
                    Okay I need to stop this sappy bullshit. I might need to start a new
                    blog just for all that. In fact I think that will be another one of
                    my side projects. I really like making web pages but to be honest
                    its the software engineering thats really getting me hot. See you
                    soon foos.

            <p class="blogentry">
                I have had a really rough week at work. Nothing super serious just a
                whole lot of work and a whole lot of responsibility put on my
                shoulders. I am happy to help because fuck I want to make more money
                and if they want to promote me so be it. Anything to allow myself
                enough funds to afford to take breaks and possible go to school and
                get my shit together. Lately I have been making a lot of changes that
                I used to have little self control in how I move through life. Its
                hard for me to say no. It doesnt matter what it is. I mean, sometimes
                I do make the right decision but then I 'reward' myself with doing all
                the crazy shit I tell myself to stop doing. I feel like a fat sack of
                shit because honestly I am. I am not so overweight that I can not move
                the way I do hell I rock climb (5.10b baby) I can do pull-ups and
                chin-ups at my weight I do not care what anyone says I am very proud
                of the three I can of each. I tend to not take care of myself how I
                should. I am getting older I know this and my body does not recover
                like it used to and I still live my life like I am going to live
                forever. The new found backpain I have been getting is telling me
                other wise. <br />
                Anywho, for some good coding news! I finally learned enough python to
                figure out how to create my CSGO win lose counter with averages v0.01
                its totally garbage but fuck it felt good to finally be able to create
                something with python that was mine and not some youtube tutorial that
                just walked me through the steps. Ever small victory that I get while
                on my coding journey has been an incredible feat in my eyes. I made it
                in repl.it and I am having trouble saving it on pycharm idk I have
                been spending all my time on linux lately that I have been sort of
                neglecting my main computer. All of this has been just getting me
                super deep on everything. I even started looking into pentesting and
                Kali and vm really the only thing that I have been doing on my windows
                machine. I only wish all my games worked as well on linux as they do
                on windows. I guess I could always just get an arch or debian iso and
                just run it through the vm...hmmm. <br />
                All in all I am really fucking glad things are starting to make sense.
                I hope my coding buddy comes around again. I know it can be tough.

            <h1 class="blogtitle">Still going strong...I think</h1>
            <p class="blogentry">
                Its the next day and I seriously am falling in love with the terminal
                and its opening my eyes to a whole new way to look at a computer
                system. Currently I am freezing my ass off (big suprise) atop of an
                elevated train station near the coast in shorts and a t-shirt. I
                usually can handle this level of cold with out any issues, but today I
                am shivering like crazy wishing I had at least worn pants like I
                normally do. Its almost as if the universe is telling me something.
                <br />
                Anywho...back to the whole reason I am here writing about something as
                mundane as a "text editor" (even a nubbin like me knows that emacs is
                so much more) Lets be real those in the know understand this shit is
                uber powerful. Scrubs like me barely scratching the surface cant even
                fathom what level of awesome this thing is capable of. I am finding
                ways to control my windows and frames in ways that I always wished
                visual studio code or sublime was capable of but I just, <br />
                A) Just didnt know enough. <br />
                or <br />
                B) They are not capable of it. <br />
                And to be honest I dont really care. I might take a swing at vim since
                its on this machine already (using linux popos distro atm but thinking
                about just switching to debian once I have more know how or who knows
                maybe give arch a try) So it seems silly not to try and at least give
                it a shot. Ive tried all the others but something tells me vim just
                isnt up to the tasks that emacs is. Look at me totally becoming a
                fucking emacs fan boy and I dont even know how to wipe my ass in the
                damn program. It doesnt matter I am here to stay and I cant wait to
                learn more! until next time..

            <h1 class="blogtitle">Learning Emacs!</h1>
            <p class="blogentry">
                Okay, so here I am trying out Emacs for the first time. I dont really
                know what I am doing but I am enjoying the way this works as a text
                editor. I feel like it works a little more intuitively than something
                like VS code or atom/sublime. I know its far more complicated at first
                since this thing seems to be written in an alien language but damn
                does it have a lot you can do at the tips of your fingers! I am still
                in need of a ton of practice as you can probably tell since I don't
                know how to properly utilize the keybinds or what have you since I am
                pretty much going at this blind but I was able to use the dired to
                find this html file on my computer. Damn I can already tell how
                powerful this thing is and I can't wait to get a better understanding
                of this thing. <br />
                I can say that this will force me to be a bit better at manually
                beautifying my code so its easier to read since I keep using editors
                that seem to do everything for you and I really don't know what I am
                doing wrong in order to create easier to read code. <br />
                <!--Okay i fucked up somewhere and had to re-dl the html file because I didnt pull prior to commiting. I was lost and git rm from the repo and lost the file. ended up fetching dont know if it solved the problem-->
                what the hell am i doing here? I keep messing up my github shit!
                <em>update 2.19.20:</em> <span>Okay</span> so I have been learning a
                bit about what I am doing here on emacs. I have learned to use the irc
                channels using emacs ERC mafs! Spoke to some randoms in my home state
                and it was alright not really what I would expect in the anime channel
                but hey what ever works right? I have been learning to navigate using
                the c commands and its getting a little easier to operate this dang
                thing. To be honest I have also been spending a bit of my free time
                not learning but playing this game called hacknet on steam and it
                actually has made my ability to navigate using the terminal much
                easier. It pretty much uses a terminal the entire time and I find
                myself relying less and less on the gui and more on the terminal. Is
                it perfect? Hell no but it is allowing me to be more comfortable with
                the living inside the command line. <br />
                one thing though that is kind of pissing me off is that I cant get the
                terminal version of emacs to launch when using the command line. I
                need to research what it is I may be doing wrong since it seems to me
                that I shouldnt have to use the icon to lauch the damn thing. Maybe
                its a simple fix... I don't know everywhere I have ever tried learning
                how to use emacs it just says to type emacs in the terminal and
                <span>boom</span> it just works <em>Todd_Howard.jpg</em>. <br />
                Well I have been working on my responsive web design some more since
                taking a break from pure python. Its making sense but I just want to
                focus more on the thing that I have been working towards for now
                python is my side project something to keep me motivated when I lose
                the will to live doing web dev. I tend to over work myself and take it
                to a place I really shouldnt when I learn something new. Burn out on a
                whole new level. Who knows I might end up falling in love with python
                so much I might want to make it a career choice. For now lets focus on
                not going crazy with the divs amitrite? Speaking of which I am working
                on a new site something a little better also a project to help me
                stretch my muscles because I know this site is utter shit but its
                keeping me typing and coding how ever I can. Its my little slice of
                accountability. I probably wont ever stop posting to this garbage fire
                of a site. I just love it too much :D. until next time! <br />
                Wait theres more! I learned to split the screen into two frames and
                switching between the two using <code> C-x o </code> its super basic
                but it fucking works!

            <em>2/11/20</em>
            <p class="blogentry">
                Hi again! So I have been taking a little time to think about myself
                and to relax a bit. If you can't tell I just played Doki Doki
                Literature Club. My fuck is that game nothing that I expected and I
                love the fuck out of it. Its turning me into a body pillow wanting
                incel (m'lady) <br />
                of course I am kidding although it did invade my every thought for a
                good while. <br />
                Still trying to get the python thing up and going I am starting to
                understand it more and more everyday and I have a couple courses on
                udemy on the subject so I am trying to take it slow while I digest as
                much as I can. Taking notes when ever I need to try and retain
                something. It has been a very positive experience for me and has been
                keeping me in a good mind space as I scream out from my tiny apartment
                in Los Angeles hating every moment I stay here longer. <br />
                I have lived here my entire life and I am getting sick of the whole
                place. The worse it gets the more expensive it is just to survive out
                here. I can at least say that all this is giving me the inspo to keep
                going and try to get myself out of this shitty situation (pun
                intended). <br />
                I have also been getting really fat and it has been really annoying. I
                just don't have a really good plan of attack and all the drinking and
                smoking might be catching up to me. I need to make a real effort to
                cut out sugar as much as I can from my diet since it wont be helping
                anything at all right?. <br />
                God, look at me, complaining like a school girl... <br />
                <br />
                OH! I have been watching a new anime recently (new for me of course)
                called Flowers of Evil. Its only 13 episodes and I am about half-way
                through but I can't stop watching it. Its a really gripping story and
                I am actually interested in diving into the manga which doesn't seem
                to be much different but I think the story is good enough to support
                its creator more. <br />
                I feel happier than usaul. Maybe its all the suicide and killing I
                have been exposing myself to but I don't feel as depressed as I

                I have a difficult time making proper choices when it comes to my well
                being. Sure I will make the right decision when it pertains to others
                but myself? Fuck that. It is a problem I tend to struggle with only
                because I think that my body can still handle the crazy shit I put it
                through. I have been better at doing it mainly because my current job
                is actually alright. I tend to get more sleep and eat better and
                exercise more because I know in the long run it can only be a positive
                for me. Not to mention this and all the time I am spending making
                things look better and learning as much as I can even going so far as
                getting familiar with Linux so I can have a more rounded skill set
                that can put me where ever the winds may take me. I am still hungover
                but only slightly and being at work today reminded me that I could
                potentially be fucking up something that I really care about instead
                of just being the selfish prick that just wants to have fun and thats
                all he thinks about. It's okay though I need cathartic moments to keep
                me in line. Tonight though is more python fun and some extra time to
                keep making this page better. Also need to spend some time finding a
                web hosting service and actually put money where my mouth is.

            <p class="blogentry">
                So I threw myself into a new project! Learning Python! I know I know I
                am spreading myself super thin, but hear me out. I can still learn to
                make better web pages while learning this language. It will allow me
                to at least not get sick of looking at the same exact thing and I
                think python is pretty cool. Plus the udemy course I am taking will
                use python in web dev so there. <br />
                So I think the first thing I should do is try to explain in the
                simplest form how python works.
                <br />
                <br />
                So here goes: <br />
                Python work by taking a source code such as:
                <code>print('Hello World')</code> <br />
                using an translator and then running the code through an interpreter
                or compiler it returns <br />
                <code>Hello World</code> <br />
                This is as simple as it gets. Using other functions such as: <br />
                <code>input('What is your name?) <br />
            print('Hello ')</code>
                <br />
                Will return <br />
                <code>What is your name?</code> <br />
                which will allow you to input a response such as: <br />
                <code>What is your name? Cool Guy</code> <br />
                the print function will input the response <br />
                <code>Hello Cool Guy</code> <br />
                As I said this is just a very simple example of how python works and
                really its about as much as I have learned so far. Wish me luck!

                I have been keeping busy with the web page. I am making some progress
                with how its turning out but its still slow going. The best part is in
                the middle of doing all this I decided to install Linux on my old
                laptop (which I am using right now!) So thats giving me a lot to deal
                with. Oh! and im trying to learn emacs too! totally don't have ADD.

            <em>1/31/20</em>
            <p class="blogentry">
                Okay! Its time to actually try and learn something and share what I
                know for once. Its funny thats what the point of every blog I've made
                in the last few months but I never get around to the whole "learning"
                part! <br />
                Any-who, I am going to take a moment to learn about grind. The
                difference between flex and grid and how it can be used. Condensed and
                digestible...hopefully. <br />
                <br />
                First: The difference of flex and grid! really the biggest difference
                is flex box is for one dimensional layouts of columns or rows and grid
                is a for two dimensional layouts of columns AND rows. <br />
                The grid allows you to accomplish what flex can but "easier". things
                that would take multiple flex elements can be done in one grid. <br />
                for instance in order to create a grid and set its col widths : <br />
                <br />
                <code>
            .container{ <br />
            display: grid; <br />
            grid-template-columns: 40% 30% 30%;</code>
                <br />
                This creates 3 columns taking up their respective space with in the
                limits of the selector that they inhabit. For example if the space is
                200px long the first column would inhabit 80px and the next two will
                be 60px wide each. making a total of...you guessed it 200px! Pretty
                simple idea right? <br />
                What if you want to have some spacing between the columns? Well thats
                simple! <br />
                Just add: <br />
                <br />
                <code>
            grid-column-gap: 1em;
            </code>
                <br />
                Its great for spacing out your grid elements just how you want them.
                This gap is called a
                <br />
                <code>gutter</code><br />
                There you have it everything you need to get grid up and running. all
                its takes is: <br />
                <br />
                <code>
            .container{ <br />
            display: grid; <br />
            grid-template-column: *insert units* <br />
            grid-column-gap: *more units* <br />
            } <br />
          </code>
                Hope this sticks with me. I know I can explain it better but I am
                making the mistake of cooking reading listening and typing all at the
                same time! Wonder why I never learn anything very well. I will revisit
                this in the very near future as of now I am basically taking notes
                haha!

                Last night I tried adding my git-hub profile to the blog using an img
                I found and NOT using font-awesome because I am trying not to use
                bootstrap until after I get a pretty good grasp of what I am doing on
                CSS. I spent a pretty good amount of time trying to resize and center
                the damn thing because I wasn't treating it as an in-line element.
                When I read that on stackoverflow my face went blank (img for ref)
                This just showed me what my bosses have been saying to me and I am
                pretty aware of, my attention to detail is fucking garbage. I need to
                work on this and I don't really know exactly how I can go about this.
                It seems to be an inherit trait in people to be able to pay attention
                and I am almost incapable of doing it. To be honest I am amazed at how
                much of all this is sticking with me but to be fair I have been trying
                for some time now. <br />
                Anywho... I have work soon and just want to remind myself that imgs
                are an in-line element and I can use css to center it with
                <br /><br /><code>text-align: center;</code><br /><br />
                theres also a way to make that happen with display but I need to
                research that further. So much work! Welp until next time!

                Okay first things first. I have been keeping up with coding sorta
                since a month ago. I had a power outage and started a new page but I
                kind of already abandoned it for this one again. I also put some work
                into my Rust (the game not the lang) crew's webpage. Really it is more
                of a practice in CSS than anything else as well as some bootstrap
                practice. Not going to lie I feel like I didnt make a whole lot of
                progress but every little thing that I did that made a change I wanted
                felt so great! <br />
                On another note work has also been working me ragged but in a good
                way. There might be a chance that I may get promoted again before too
                long. It's hard to say but I am very hopeful. <br />
                With all this good news it has been kick driving me into making better
                choices for myself and even started food prepping like a boss (not
                really) but it is allowing me to not spend so much damn money on
                terrible food that is making me fatter every damn day. I also want to
                use that extra funds to be able to hit the climbing gym again.
                Something that I plan on doing today. <br />
                Anywho thats all for now! <br />
                <em class="postscript">P.S. I know what I am doing right now is not programing but I am
                    learning JS and im dipping my toes in pyth and kinda looking at rust

                any way to have a line of credit. I felt so powerless sometimes. It

                Okay, its time to start this whole thing over. This is still going
                very slow its almost an entire month since I started this. I don't
                think I can completely blame my depression on this stalling since its
                pretty much par for the course on how I have been living my life up
                until now. The words "idontwanttobeyouanymore" coming through my
                speakers is kind of poignant right now. Even though over arching theme
                of the song doesn't really apply to me. I really don't want to be this
                person I am anymore. I have been making slow changes to create some
                sense of structure and planning to my every day life. Not to mention
                slowly but surely "cleaning my room" as it were. yesterday was a tough
                day for me at work and it drove me into a very distressing and
                suicidal point. The funny thing is: nothing really happened to me
                yesterday. I am just getting bored with the life that I have allowed
                myself to fall into. Its my fault entirely. I should be making the
                progress I wish but because its so slow coming and I have no idea what
                the fuck I am actually doing I end up taking on too many hobbies and
                desire to have too many skills and end up with nothing. My gluttony
                knows no bounds and I sit here wondering what is the next thing I will
                absorb and turn into nothingness like all the things before. Part of
                me wishes I just stayed dead when I over dosed a year ago and yet the
                other part just doesn't care. Did I learn something? Yeah, don't
                accept questionable white powders from anyone anymore. Other than that
                I still do drugs and I still drink. My ability to be responsible and
                do these things has risen though. So I guess I am improving.
